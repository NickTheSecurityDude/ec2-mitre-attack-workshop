# EC2 Mitre Attack Workshop

In this workshop you will simulate an AWS account breach from start to finish, starting with reconnaissance, ending with impact, and a number of steps in between such as credential access, privilege escalation and exfiltration.

To get started you will need:
- an AWS Account (using the us-west-2 region)
- your IPv4 source IP
- a domain (or subdomain provided by the workshop)
